# Backend Development with Node.js & Modern Tooling

This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience in building **scalable, secure, and production-ready backend applications** using **Node.js** and modern backend tools. It covers backend fundamentals, database design, authentication, system design concepts, and containerized deployments.

---
## 📌 Overview

The goal of this repository is to strengthen core backend engineering skills while following **real-world architecture patterns** and **industry best practices**.

---

## 🏗 Backend Architecture

- MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern
- Clean and scalable folder structure
- Separation of concerns
- Maintainable and reusable codebase

---

## 🗄 Databases & Data Modeling

### SQL & NoSQL
- Understanding when to use SQL vs NoSQL
- Real-world data modeling strategies

### PostgreSQL (SQL)
- PostgreSQL with Dockerized environments
- Schema design and normalization
- Relationships, indexing, and performance optimization
- Type-safe queries using **Drizzle ORM**

### MongoDB (NoSQL)
- CRUD operations using MongoDB
- Schema modeling with Mongoose
- Aggregation pipelines for advanced querying

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

Security-focused backend implementations:
- Session-based authentication
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Express middleware for route protection
- Clear distinction between authentication and authorization

---

## 🎨 Server-Side Rendering

- Dynamic HTML rendering using **EJS**
- Understanding backend-driven templating

---

## 🧪 API Development & Testing

- RESTful API design
- API testing and debugging using **Postman**
- Environment-based API workflows

---

## 📦 Production Readiness & Deployment

### System Design Concepts
- Reverse proxy vs forward proxy
- Vertical vs horizontal scaling
- Blue-green and rolling deployments

### Containerization & Deployment
- Dockerizing Node.js applications
- Container-based development workflows
- Pushing Docker images to **AWS ECR**
- Production-oriented deployment practices

---
